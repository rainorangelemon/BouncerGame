One variant I want to add:
An power up that the paddle can move vertically. Because if the paddle can move vertically, 
it can use its short sides to make the ball bounce, but there is also risk to make the ball fall into the ground.
So I think this is interesting.

A general description of blocks:
The 0 means the block that cannot be destroyed.
In the first level, there may be three layers of bricks that can be destroyed in one time.
In the second level, there may be 
In the third level, most of the bricks that can be destroyed in one time
are surrounded by the bricks that cannot be destroyed, the only entrance to these bricks is covered by two paralleling
bricks that can be destroyed in three times.

Several different blocks:
1. can not be destroyed
2. can be destroyed in one hit
3. can be destroyed after three hits and will drop random power up

Several power ups:
1. to let the ball have the ability to go through the wall for limited time.
2. stick the balls to the paddle when pressing S and shoot it in a limited direction after releasing the key.
3. the paddle can move vertically.

Several cheat keys:
Press the number between 1-3 to enter the corresponding level.

Something extra I intend to add: 
I will provided a directory that people can put their text files of block configuration into the file,
then they can play the game on their own map.
The reason I want to add it is that people may not be satisfied with the original maps, they may want to do some
revision to the maps. So I provide the directory and help them to build their own maps.
